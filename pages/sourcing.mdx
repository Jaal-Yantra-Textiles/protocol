We present a comprehensive Sourcing protocol that includes a scoring evaluation method to assess and select suppliers of raw materials such as yarn, organic cotton, or any other materials that can be transformed into fabrics for garment production. This sourcing protocol will emphasize key factors such as direct sourcing, supplier networks, fair trade practices, supply chain transparency, contractual agreements, and the educational level of the weavers and other individuals involved in the sourcing of materials.

### Sourcing Operating Procedure (SOP) for Raw Materials

**Objective**: To standardize the procurement of sustainable and ethically sourced raw materials used in garment and fabric production.

**Scope**: This procedure applies to all sourcing activities related to raw materials such as yarn, organic cotton, and other textiles.

#### 1. **Sourcing Criteria Definition**

The sourcing team must evaluate potential suppliers based on the following criteria, each with an assigned score that contributes to an overall supplier rating:

- **Quality of Material (20 points)**: Assess the quality standards of raw materials. Samples should be tested for durability, colorfastness, and compliance with international quality standards.

- **Sustainability Practices (20 points)**: Evaluate the supplier’s commitment to sustainability. This includes the use of organic materials, renewable energy in manufacturing processes, and water conservation techniques.

- **Fair Trade and Ethics (20 points)**: Ensure that suppliers adhere to fair trade practices. This includes fair wages, working conditions, and worker rights.

- **Supply Chain Transparency (15 points)**: Suppliers must provide clear documentation of their supply chain, from the origin of raw materials to the delivery processes.

- **Direct Sourcing and Network (15 points)**: Preference for suppliers who facilitate direct sourcing to minimize supply chain steps and reduce associated costs and risks.

- **Agreements and Compliance (10 points)**: Suppliers must have formal agreements that comply with international trade laws and standards.

#### 2. **Evaluation of Additional Variables**

- **Influence of External Factors (variable score)**: Assess external factors such as geopolitical stability, environmental regulations, and economic conditions that may affect material availability and pricing.

#### 3. **Sourcing Process**

- **Supplier Identification**: Compile a list of potential suppliers who meet the basic criteria for material quality and availability.

- **Initial Screening**: Conduct an initial review based on submitted documents, certifications, and compliance with sustainability and fair trade practices.

- **Scoring Evaluation**: Utilize the scoring criteria to rate each supplier. Suppliers must achieve a minimum score of 70 out of 100 to proceed to the next stage.

- **Site Visits and Audits**: Conduct on-site visits and third-party audits for suppliers who pass the initial screening and scoring phases.

- **Supplier Selection**: Choose suppliers based on the highest scores and best alignment with organizational values and needs.

#### 4. **Contract Negotiation and Finalization**

- **Drafting Agreements**: Prepare contractual agreements that outline terms of delivery, pricing, quality checks, and penalty clauses for non-compliance.

- **Signing of Contracts**: Contracts to be reviewed and signed by both parties to ensure mutual understanding and agreement.

#### 5. **Monitoring and Continuous Improvement**

- **Performance Tracking**: Regularly assess supplier performance against contract terms.

- **Feedback and Improvement**: Provide feedback to suppliers and work together to address any areas of improvement.

- **Review and Adaptation of Sourcing Criteria**: Periodically review and update the sourcing criteria to adapt to new challenges and opportunities in the supply chain.

### Documentation and Record Keeping

- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive records of all sourcing activities, including supplier evaluations, audit reports, contracts, and communication.

- **Compliance and Auditing**: Ensure all documents are auditable and comply with internal standards and external regulatory requirements.

This sourcing protocol ensures that the sourcing of raw materials is conducted in a fair, ethical, and sustainable manner, reflecting the organization’s commitment to quality and corporate responsibility.
