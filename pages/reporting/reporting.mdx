A Reporting Operating Protocol (ROP) is essential for ensuring that visits to sourcing partners or collaborators are conducted effectively and yield accurate, useful information for a fully sustainable textiles company. Here’s a structured ROP that can be adapted to your company's specific needs, ensuring that each visit is well-documented and contributes positively to your sustainability goals.

### 1. Purpose of the Reporting Operating Protocol

The purpose of this ROP is to standardize the process of gathering and reporting information during visits to sourcing partners or collaboration partners. This protocol is designed to ensure consistency in data collection, especially regarding weaver practices and sustainability measures, and to facilitate comprehensive reporting that supports the company's sustainability commitments.

### 2. Scope of the Protocol

This protocol covers:

- Pre-visit preparations including reporter selection and briefing.
- Specific data collection methodologies during the visit.
- Post-visit report generation and review process.

### 3. Pre-Visit Procedures
